Switchpy
========

Use a symlink folder to switch between different Python distributions. Switchpy
looks for a directory containing the word "python" in the PATH. It then creates
a symlink at that location to a chosen  Python distribution. If the Symlink 
location is in a write protected folder switchpy needs to be run with sudo. 


Installing
==========

    $ sudo python setup.py install
