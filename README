New (EPD readme)
================

do this::

    $ sudo ln -fhs /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/7.2 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current

and check .bash_profile for path definition (it should add .../Versions/Current)


Old

Apparently ``/usr/bin/python`` calls ``/usr/bin/pythonXXX`` where XXX reflects
the version (e.g., 2.7), probably depending on OS-X settings? The settings can
be modified with::

    $ defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 2.6




it is posible to just point the path to a desired python distriution, e.g.::

    PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/7.2/bin:${PATH}" # EPD 32
    export PATH

but virtualenv (which seems to use bin/python) does not work with that. It
looks (supposedly) at: /usr/local/bin/python


    $ cd /usr/local/bin
    /usr/local/bin$ ls -l python*

virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.6
